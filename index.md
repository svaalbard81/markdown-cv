## Employment and Work Experience


`May 2009 - Present Day`
__Lead Software Engineer for CCEA.__

As one of the lead developers in the ICT team I architect and develop high quality solutions in a high-stakes, no-fail environment.  During my time in CCEA I have developed an OMR Suite, Centre Management system, web services for the A2C project, a system to manage the creation of CCEA's qualifications, web services for login authentication and an XML message generator for CCEA's product catalogue.  
At CCEA the main technologies I have used are Java, PrimeFaces, IceFaces, Spring (Spring Boot), Hibernate, CA2e and VB.Net.  In most projects I connect to both MS SQL databases and an AS400 mainframe - creating tables, running queries and managing data.  As part of this database work I have been made administrator on the main development and production SQL servers - helping other team members with their database requirements. 

On a daily basis I use an Agile lifecycle, conforming and contributing to the implementation of TickIT quality management system.  I organise Sprints, allocate tasks, and run daily standups and sprint planning meetings.

To ensure quality of projects I work under a continuous integration system and develop JUnit tests to work towards Test Driven Development in my code.  

As one of the most experienced people in the team I have mentored several team members, bringing them up to a high standard of work in a short period of time and also assist both team members and non-ICT staff where possible.

I have achieved Java Certification and attended training in Java, writing SharePoint web parts, JUnit, Test Driven Development and Hibernate whilst working for CCEA.

I am responsible for the developer operations work in CCEA creating a continuous integration environment that includes JIRA, BitBucket, Git, Nexus, Maven and SonarQube to deploy onto Apache servers.

I have a high focus on quality working on several team improvements including bringing in unit testing, API testing and static analysis.


`Sept 2008 - May 2009`
__Senior Software Engineer for ION.__

As Senior developer I delivered several applications under an agile lifecycle, responding quickly to customer needs in a demanding, no-fail environment.  During this time I used Java and Perl and C# .NET to produce an e-commerce system for McCausland's Airport Parking and to implement VAT changes for the Value Cabs billing system.


`Oct 2003 - Sept 2008`
__Software Engineer for the Department for Regional Development.__

Working in the Information Systems Unit Web Development team as a Programmer Analyst in charge of a small team, I developed several Intranet and Internet applications for the Department and its Agencies. This included an application system for the Blue Badge Scheme and an Active Directory self service portal.  This work was mainly in ASP.NET (C#), VBScript, JavaScript and HTML, accessing SQL Server Databases and Active Directory.  I was lead developer on a SharePoint proof of concept project creating custom web parts.  As architect on most systems for the team, I used Object-Oriented design and development techniques and was responsible for designing SQL databases.  I developed a web based Map viewer and was familiar with GIS concepts.  During my time with DRD I attended training on Microsoft .NET including C#, SharePoint, ethical hacking, CSS and accessibility issues for Web Development.  I also completed the management development programme part 1 and attended a Key Players course on PRINCE 2.


`Aug 2003 - Oct 2003`
__Staff Officer in the Social Security Agency.__

I succeeded in  gaining a post as a graduate entry Staff Officer in the Civil Service.  This involved a complete day of tests including role plays, group work, individual work and an interview.  Once in post, I was tasked with organising a major conference held in Belfast City Hall to mark the European Year of People with Disabilities.  As head of a team I had to make decisions on advertising, costs, contracts and the delegation of tasks as well as reporting back on progress to the overall Project Steering Group.  


`Sept 2001 - Jun 2002`
__Student Software Engineer at Nortel Networks.__

During my placement year I was given many different tasks encompassing various aspects of computer work. Initially I was tasked with integration testing and providing a design environment.  This involved installing of the software from the operating system up.  I then moved on to software development and produced several components for a software release.  Most of my work was carried out using Java and Perl in both the Windows and Unix Operating Systems.  Based on my performance during my placement Nortel sponsored my final year at university.


`Oct 1997 - Aug 2001`
__General Assistant in Safeways Stores PLC.__ 

As a General assistant I mainly worked in the Cash Office of the store.  I was responsible for the counting and banking of the takings as well as assisting in compiling sales figures and other administrative tasks.  In addition to this, I worked on checkouts and on the deli and butchery counters.  All these jobs involved communicating with both customers and management in the store.

## Other IT Experience

In addition to the experience gained during previous jobs and work experience, I have developed in many other languages using several different Operating Systems.  These include Visual Basic, Prolog, C++ in both the Windows, and Unix operating systems.  

I designed and developed an E-Commerce site using PHP and a MySQL database.  This system has now been successfully running for several years.  I developed a Church Database and Accounting system using Java, Spring, Hibernate and Icefaces to connect to a MySQL database.

For my final year project I developed an Alarm Correlation Analysis Tool that looked for patterns in the Alarm Logs of Network Elements in Telecommunication Systems.  This covered the whole life cycle and Development was carried out in Java and XML.  

As a member of the British Computer Society I keep up to date with most technology advances and undertake continuing professional development.


## Personal Statement

I am trustworthy, responsible, well organised and can work well independently and in a team.  I communicate well with others and take information on board quickly.  I can apply problem-solving skills to most situations where they are required.

I am a strong engineering professional who enjoys learning new skills that enable me to continuously improve the quality of my work.  As part of this I actively work through Udemy courses and organised a subscription for my team to help their development.  I have recently started attending the Kotlin user group meetups.

I enjoy leadership roles and believe that I am hard-working and disciplined.  This is demonstrated by the achievement of black belt in Ju-Jitsu and my grade 6 in music, which required both. These skills help me to develop as a Software Engineer and continually improve as I work.
